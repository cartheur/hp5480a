</p><p>
Today, the DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope) is ubiquitous in electronics labs and workshops, having supplanted the analog scope and surpassed the latter in capability.
They are also <i>amazing</i> instruments if one has been used to using analog scopes.
There were storage oscilloscopes prior to the DSO, relying on a special holding-beam type of CRT, but these were limited to what amounts to a screen capture and were far more expensive and less common than standard scopes.

</p><p>
DSOs emerged as replacements for the analog oscilloscope starting in the early 1970s.
The  Nicolet 1090 <a href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/index.html#refNic1090">[ref]</a> (circa 1973) is an example, explicitly referred to and promoted as a "Digital Storage Oscilloscope".
Due to limits of speed and memory, these early instruments were certainly not capable of replacing the general purpose analog scope in all applications.

</p><p>
Earlier, in the 1960s, some instruments were developed for specialised applications, largely in nuclear instrumentation, such as
Multi-Channel-Scalers, Pulse-Height Analysers, and Signal Averagers.
A common aspect of these instruments is the use of digital electronics, processing, and memory.

In totality they contained all the functional elements of the DSO:
</p><ul>
<li>Input signal amplifiers
</li><li>Sample-&amp;-Hold
</li><li>Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
</li><li>Digital Memory
</li><li>Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
</li><li>Display
</li></ul>
Given the time, these elements were too limited in speed and capacity to produce a DSO that could replace a conventional oscilloscope.
They can however, be seen as presaging the DSO.
The instrument presented here - the HP5480 - could, within its limitations, function as a DSO.

<p>
The HP-5480A Digital Signal Analyser was introduced in early 1968.
Quoting from its announcement <a href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/index.html#refAnnounce">[ref]</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Also known as a signal averager or enhancer, the <b>5480A</b> Signal Analyzer recovers repetitive signals buried in noise by averaging out that noise.
It's ideally suited for applications in medicine, biology, spectroscopy, physics and vibrations analysis, as well as electronics.
</blockquote>

The 5480 also does Multi-Channel-Scaling, and time and frequency histograms.
With some external pulse-amplitude-discriminators it could be a Pulse-Height Analyser. 
It appears to be an attempt by HP to address several small markets for specialised instruments by producing one multi-function instrument.
The basic specifications of the 5480 are 9/7/5-bit A-D resolution, up to 100KHz A-D conversion rate, and 1024*24-bit memory. 
The display resolution is 1000 H * 1024 V.

<p>
The Northern Scientific NS-544 Digital Memory Oscilloscope <a href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/index.html#refNic544">[ref]</a> is another example, also from the 1967-68 period.
Basic specs for the NS-544 are 7-bit A-D resolution, 16KHz A-D conversion rate, and 1024*16-bit memory.

</p><p>
The 5480 was announced in HP's Spring 1968 "New Instruments" catalog, and is last listed in the 1973 catalog.
A catalog entry from ~ 1970 indicates the price for the 5480 configuration shown here would be $6950+$1500+$1800+$300 = $10,550, which inflates to $78,200 in 2022.
The unit here has a property label from the B.C. Children's Hospital, and a calibration sticker from Jan 1975.
The 5480 listed weight is 76 lb (34.5 Kg).

</p><p>
The HP Journal articles linked below present some examples of use of the HP 5480,
one of which was analysing signals from pulsars in the period shortly after their discovery.

<h3>Operation</h3>

<a target="large" href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/large/front.jpg"><img class="pic" align="right" src="./HP-5480A DSA_files/front.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>

<p>
The 5480 implements 6 process functions, selected by the FUNCTION switch:
</p><ul>
<li> CALIBRATED AVERAGE
</li><li> WEIGHTED AVERAGE
</li><li> SUMMATION
</li><li> FREQUENCY HISTOGRAM
</li><li> PERIOD HISTOGRAM
</li><li> MCS (Multi-Channel Scaling)
</li></ul>

Average and Summation have some similarity, but otherwise these functions are quite distinct in what they do, essentially configuring the system into different instruments.


<p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>CALIBRATED AVERAGE</h4>

Input signals are averaged over a preset number of sweeps.

<p>
Select: FUNCTION=AVERAGE, PRE/NORM=PRESET.
<br>
[Operating Manual, Figure 3-7, pdf.50::51]


</p><p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>WEIGHTED AVERAGE</h4>
Input signals are averaged until manually stopped.
SWEEP-COUNT is the weighting constant for sweeps.
E.g.: With SWEEP-COUNT set to 5, once past 32 sweeps each new sweep will contribute 1/32 to the average.
With SWEEP-COUNT set to 2, once past 4 sweeps each new sweep will contribute 1/4  to the average.
<p>
The averaging can be observed in action by varying an input signal during execution.
The lower the SWEEP-COUNT setting, the faster the new signal will appear out of the old average, as individual sweeps makes a larger contribution to the cumulative average.

</p><p>
Select: FUNCTION=AVERAGE, PRE/NORM=NORMAL.
<br>
[Operating Manual, Figure 3-7, pdf.50::51]


</p><p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>SUMMATION</h4>
Each sweep adds to an accumulating total of all sweeps.
The sum can quickly go 'offscale' of the display, the SENSITIVITY MULTIPLIER can be set to scale the result down by factors of 2^n.

<p>
[Operating Manual, Figure 3-8, pdf.52::53]


</p><p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>FREQUENCY HISTOGRAM</h4>

<table align="right" cellspacing="20">
<tbody><tr><td class="fig" valign="top">
<a target="large" href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/large/histf.jpg">  <img src="./HP-5480A DSA_files/histf.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a><br>
Frequency histogram test. A signal generator was adjusted from 100KHz to 1MHz while stopping briefly every 100KHz.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Presents an occurrence distribution of measured frequency.
In contrast to the other functions, the horizontal axis for the histogram functions is not time.

</p><p>
The frequency of the input signal is measured, in the manner of a frequency counter, by counting input transitions for a selected gate time.
The resultant count is then used as an address into memory, and that memory location incremented to indicate an occurrence of that frequency.
Over many gate periods then, a histogram of the signal frequency is built.

</p><p>
For example, with the SWEEP RATE set at 100mS/cm, the gate time will be 1mS=100mS/100 (note 'sweep rate' is a misnomer here, the S-R switch is selecting the gate period).
A 1MHz input signal will produce a count of 1000 in 1mS.
Say, during the process, that 1MHz is 'seen' for 52 gate periods.
At the end of the process, memory location 1000 would record 52, and the display would present a dot at height '52' vertically on the far right of the display (10/10ths or 10cm from the left).
If 600KHz was seen for 101 gate periods, then a dot would present at height '101' at 6/10ths (6cm) from the left of the sweep. 

</p><p>
The signal to be analysed is input on the TRIGGER input, not one of the channel inputs of the input module.

</p><p>
[Operating Manual, Figure 3-9, pdf.54]

</p><p>
<b>Test Example:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Set FUNCTION: HISTOGRAM, HISTOGRAM: FREQ.
</li><li>Set SWEEP RATE: 100mS/cm. This sets a gate time of 1mS.
</li><li>Set SYNC SOURCE: EXTERNAL.
</li><li>Attach signal generator to External Sync input.
Set level appropriately to trigger input.
Set generator to produce signal variable from 100KHz to 1MHz.
</li><li> Press Clear-Memory &amp; START. Vary generator frequency in 100KHz steps, stopping at each step for several seconds.
</li><li>Press STOP, DISPLAY. Display should present spikes at 1cm intervals along the horizontal. SENS-MULT may need to be increased to observe spikes.
</li></ul>


<p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>PERIOD HISTOGRAM</h4>
Similar to the Frequency Histogram function but measuring period rather than frequency.
The period of the input signal is measured, by counting a selected reference frequency for a gate time determined by the input.
These period measurements are tallied into corresponding memory locations to build a histogram.


<p></p><hr width="50%" align="left">
<h4>MCS (Multi-Channel Scaling)</h4>

<table align="right" cellspacing="20">
<tbody><tr><td class="fig" valign="top">
<a target="large" href="http://madrona.ca/e/HP5480A/large/mcs.jpg">  <img src="./HP-5480A DSA_files/mcs.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a><br>
Multi-Channel Scaling test. A signal generator manually stepped up from 2 KHz to 11KHz, then gradually reduced down to 3KHz.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Produces a plot of event counts across time.
The horizontal axis is time, in accordance with the setting of SWEEP_RATE.
The vertical axis is the count of events seen at the MCS input during that fractional step period of the sweep. As the step periods are all equal, the vertical axis is presenting frequency.

</p><pre>    STEP_PERIOD(t/step) = SWEEP_RATE(t/cm) * 1(cm) / 100(steps)
</pre>

<p>
In practice, during the sweep, memory is stepped through one location at a time, at each step a count of input events occurring during that step period is recorded in the current location.

</p><p>
"Channel" here is nothing to do with the signal input channels, the "channels" are conceptually the step periods for which events are counted, akin to channel in the sense of time-division-multiplexing.
The events are pulses input via the MCS input on the rear panel.
The front-panel signal input(s) were not used here for some reason.

<h3>Using the 5480A as a DSO</h3>

Capture of 4 channels of logic state. The sweep rate here is 10mS/cm.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
It is possible to use the 5480A as a DSO, albeit limited to some low KHz of signal capture.
The image to the right shows the 5480 acting - in essence - as a logic analyser, capturing 4 state-sequencing signals in a Canon 161 calculator as it executes a simple multiplication (2*25).

</p><p>
The idea of course,  is to 'average' or 'sum' just one sweep:
</p><ul>
<li>Set MODE = AVERAGE or SUM.
</li><li>Set SWEEP COUNT = 0 (2^0=1).
</li><li>The 5480 does not provide an internal route from the signal inputs to the sweep trigger, in contrast to a normal oscilloscope.
There is an input for an external trigger however. Tee an input signal off to the TRIGGER input or use another appropriate source signal if available.
</li><li>Set TRIGGER SOURCE = EXTERNAL, adjust TRIGGER LEVEL.
</li></ul>

<p>
Note: The TRIGGER input is 1M impedance at low voltage but has clamps at ~ 3V thru only 82 ohms, thus may affect an input signal over 3V. AC mode adds a 0.1 uF capacitor in series.

<h3>Technical / Implementation</h3>

<img class="pic" align="right" src="./HP-5480A DSA_files/5480Block.png" width="813" height="639">

<p>
The digital logic of the 5480 is implemented with TTL ICs, primarily 7400 and 74H00 series.
Most of these ICs are SSI although a few 7490 MSI devices are present.

</p><p>
The block diagram to the right presents the functional internal structure and primary signal and data paths.
There is no CPU, hard-wired logic executes the process sequences.
</p><p>
The accumulator may be considered the focal point of the design.
The accumulator is a 24-bit register with several ALU functions incorporated: count-up, count-down, shift and rotate - both left and right, parallel-load, and clear.
All arithmetic is performed by count and shift functions, there is no binary adder.

</p><p>
All digitised signal data goes through the accumulator, during both input capture and processing, and output recall.
</p><ul>
<li>The analog-to-digital converter is a slope-integrating type, the accumulator acts as the counter for the A-D conversion process.
</li><li>The accumulator incorporates shift-up and shift-down functionality for implementing the averaging and scaling functions.
</li><li>The accumulator acts as the word-storage register for retrieving and restoring the contents of a core-memory location.
</li></ul>

<p>
The memory is magnetic core: functionally 1024 words by 24 bits.
Physically, it is a stack of 6 planes with 4 bit-arrays per plane, wired in 3D 4-Wire form.
A small state machine is dedicated to generating the read/write cycles for the core.

</p><p>
The signal input amplifiers are potted FET-input op-amp modules from Teledyne.
The rest of the analog circuitry is entirely discrete, including some number of op-amps.
This is a little curious as some op-amp ICs such as the µA709 and LM101 were available in that period.

</p><p>
The multiple signal channels are diode-switch multiplexed into a single sample-&amp;-hold and A-D converter.
The channels can be individually enabled or disabled.
The memory is apportioned to enabled channels in full, halves or quarters.
Thus, with a single channel enabled, that channel will have a horizontal (time) resolution of 1000 (1000 words of memory dedicated to it).
With two channels enabled each channel gets 500 words, etc.

</p><p>
The A-D conversion provides up to 9-bit resolution, but is progressively reduced to 7 and 5 bits at the two fastest sweep rates:
</p><ul>
<li>5mS/cm sweep (20KHz sampling): 9-bit resolution
</li><li>2mS/cm sweep (50KHz sampling): 7-bit resolution
</li><li>1mS/cm sweep (100KHz sampling): 5-bit resolution
</li></ul>

D-A conversion provides 10-bit resolution on both the vertical and horizontal axes of the CRT display.
The horizontal display is actually only 1000 pixels rather than 1024, thus across the 10cm of the CRT horizontal graticule, 100 pixels per cm.
Some of the remaining 24 words of memory are used for variables in the process algorithms.

<p>
The much larger 24-bits of the accumulator and memory, relative to the A-D-A conversions, are provided both to allow a larger total in summation, and room for shifting for scaling and averaging.
Note the vertical DAC takes its input from the high-order bits of the accumulator.
